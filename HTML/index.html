                    <li>Integrity: I value integrity because it is allows me to
                        build better relationships with other people. Many aspects of
                        our daily life are also based on it. Living with integrity means that I do not
                        have to question myself or overthink, instead my life is peaceful and simple.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mt-2">Family: I value family because they have helped me through
                        everything and it can motivate me to do better every day. No
                        matter what happens, my family will always be there. I value family also
                        because they can make me a better person. By telling me the hard truth, it
                        can allow me to realise my problems and resolve them.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mt-2">Passion: I value passion because doing something I like
                        gives me satisfaction and allows me to just have fun. It
                        also helps me to relax from stressful times. I can talk about something I'm
                        passionate about for seemingly forever and the quality of the work that I do is
                        great for things I am passionate about because I put alot of heart into it

                <p class="h3 mt-4">My Personality</p>
                <p>
                    According to <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16Personalities</a>,
                    I am a mediator. I feel that I am more of an introvert than an extrovert. I am
                    also very passionate, putting my all into my interests. However, I can be unrealistic,
                    picturing everything perfectly only to result in failure. Another one of my weaknesses
                    is that I can be self critical, which can greatly affect my self-esteem and motivation
                    for future projects. To overcome these challenges, I need to have realistic plan and
                    acknowledge that things may not go the way I want them to.

                <p>
                    One of my interests is that I like to watch shows. I have watched a lot of shows, coming up to
                    about 80 shows. My favourite genre of shows to watch is sitcoms, or also known as situational
                    comedy. I like sitcoms alot as they are alwways funny, and I get to see how all the recurring
                    characters grow together. It allows me to escape the stressful and busy life I have and just take
                    some time to laugh and relax. Some of my favourite shows are Brooklyn Nine Nine, The Office and
                    more.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 mb-3">
                    Another one of my interests is gaming. I mainly only play one game, Dota 2. Dota 2 is a multiplayer
                    online battle arena (MOBA) where 5 players go against 5 other players, using a variety of heroes
                    with
                    unique skills. I like playing Dota 2 as it is a challenging game, and every game is different as
                    there
                    are so many hero combinations. Gaming allows me to bond with my friends, and even make new ones.
