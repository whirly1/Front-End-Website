                <p>I am enrolled in the Diploma for Applied AI and Analytics, also known
                    as DAAA. I decided to join this course because I have an interest in
                    technology. Right now, I am taking 7 modules, and some of my favourite
                    modules are Fundamentals of Programming and Front-End Web Development.
                    In these modules, I learn how to code using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
                    I am currently not drowned in my work and enjoying studying at Singapore
                    Polytechnic.

                <p>There are 6 food courts at SP, and every week I usually go to Food Court
                    4 and 5. Food Court 4 is Koufu, where there are many varieties of food. My
                    favourite food to eat is the Spicy Chicken Set from the Korean Food Stall.
                    However, Koufu is very crowded most of the time and on Thursdays, as I have a
                    longer lunch break, I go to Food Court 5, which is further from my classrooms.
                    I mainly eat Subway and Brunch Cafe, which sell Japanese rice bowls.

                <p>For my CCA, I already knew what I was joining before I came to SP. I joined SPRITE,
                    which is the Singapore Polytechnic Robotics Innovation Technology Enterprise. I joined
                    because I had prior experience in secondary school. In SPRITE, I use LEGO to build robots
                    to complete a specific task, and then competing against other schools. Winning the local
                    competition can allow me to represent Singapore on the international stage, which I have
                    done previously and would love to do again.
